# VSH2 MathKing

Add a new boss "MathKing" to [VSH2](https://github.com/VSH2-Devs/Vs-Saxton-Hale-2).

## Rage

Freeze everyone and make a random math quiz for everyone, including the boss themselves. If a red player win their quiz they are unfreezed or instantly killed by boss. The faster you finish your quiz the quicker you are able to be unfreezed and stab the boss or something if they are still struggling on their quiz.

Same for the boss, if they are able to finish their quiz before red players finish...

Boss can gain uber or drug in their quiz. Duration can be set in the boss config.
